# Color Me Quilt

The idea is to build a website that can upload a photo of a quilt, and the program will match the quilt colors with the Kona Solids quilt fabrics that are needed in the quilt.

Will need to address colors showing up differently in different lights. Would be amazing if it could also return a google search of that fabric IRL?
